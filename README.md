# VulkanEngine

Final Degree Project to render realistic shadows and transparencies for vegetation with raytracing using Vulkan and in real time.

Render Engine made with Vulkan with an hybrid rendering pipeline featuring a gbuffer pass following a ray traced shadow pass + denoising, a final raytracing pass to compute pbr and a pospo.
